# HCV-UFPR COVID-19 Xray dataset

This dataset, called HCV-UFPR COVID-19 Xray dataset was introducted in [our RBE](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42600-021-00151-6) paper.

Brazil is one of the countries most affected by covid-19, with over 6 million confirmed cases, to date.
The Hospital da Cruz Vermelha from Curitiba, located in the state of Paraná, southern Brazil, received and documented some of those cases.
The data collection consists of 281 X-ray images of people infected with COVID-19 and 232 of people who obtained negative results that are not infected.
All images have 3 eight-bit color channels (RGB) and image resolution ranges from 2974 × 2612 to 4248 × 3480 pixels. 
The images are labeled in two classes, COVID-19 and non-COVID, and there are no annotations regarding the image angle view. 
The dataset is private, but it can be made available upon request.

Here are some examples from the dataset:
